== ABOUT ==
Scarecrow is a key-value store with support for custom indexes that runs on top
of MySQL. It is inspired by an article about how FriendFeed uses MySQL to store
schema-less data: http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql

== WHY ANOTHER KEY-VALUE STORE ==
For my research work, I needed the following from a datastore:

1) The ability to store schema-less data. In implementing various prototypes,
   I found the use of schema-less data greatly reduced the amount of code I had
   to write, even compared to ORMs.
   
2) The ability to have custom indexes so I could run special queries on my
   data. A stupid key-value store would not do.
   
3) Speed. Get requests had to be especially fast.

4) The ability to swap out datastore implementations. Right now it runs only on
   MySQL, but in the future I might want to test out my research project on
   redis on GAE. Scarecrow allows me to abstract away the underlying
   engine.
